## Getting a new AsyncAPI repository approved
In case you want to donate existing project to AsyncAPI organization, or start a new project, follow below steps:
1. Visit [AsyncAPI Initiative Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions).
2. Create a new discussion by clicking on `New discussion` and selecting the `Idea` category. Specify in the _title_ that you want to create a new repository. In the _description_, specify the new repository's purpose and why it belongs under the AsyncAPI organization. [Sample new discussion example.](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/300).
3. Start a discussion with community members to initialize a new project for AsyncAPI, discuss the project ideas, specify if you want to use AsyncAPI CI/CD workflows, and volunteer to become a maintainer for that project. (At least 2 code maintainers are needed to start.)
To learn more about asyncapi `CI/CD`, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsQfmlc3Ubo)
4. The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) must approve the newly proposed repository. Make sure to tag them by adding `@asyncapi/tsc_members` at the end of the proposal description; this notifies all TSC members to vote on the proposed project.
5. If the TSC approves the new repository, then either `@derberg` or `@fmvilas` will take over creating the actual new repository. Next, they'll run AsyncAPI `CI/CD workflows`. 
6. Invite new maintainers as repo admins.
