# How to create new repository

This document is not about creating a repository on GitHub. If this is what you were looking for, then [read GitHub guides on repository creation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

This document is about creating a new repository at [AsyncAPI Initiative GitHub organization](https://github.com/asyncapi). This guide explains what is the approval process and default repository configuration options.

This document is also helpful if you are donating a project to AsyncAPI Initiative, which involves transferring repository ownership, but still becoming its maintainer.

## Creating a repo for a new project

1. Visit [AsyncAPI Initiative Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions)


2. Start a new discussion by clicking on `New discussion` and selecting the `Idea` category.

    Specify in the title that you want to create a new repository. In the description specify what is the purpose of the new repository, and why it should be created under the AsyncAPI organization. See also [example discussion from the past](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/300).


3. After starting a discussion about your new project for asyncapi, and successfully convienced other members of the community why your project ideas is necessary and you want to maintain the codebase.


4. Additionally, when creating proposal specify the initial maintainers of the project and specify if you want to use asyncapi CI/CD workflows or not, so we don't get to ask you. At least 2 code maintainers are needed to start

5. Your proposal for a new repository must be approved by Technical Steering Committee (TSC). So make sure that at the end of proposal description you mention `@asyncapi/tsc_members` GitHub team to get TSC members notified.

6. After getting approval from the TSC, Repo is created by Lukasz or Fran, we will need to distribute all `CI/CD workflow` to the users. To know more about asyncapi `CI/CD` watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsQfmlc3Ubo) and 
 invites new maintainers as admins.
