# How to create new repository

This document is not about creating a repository on GitHub. If this is what you were looking for, then [read GitHub guides on repository creation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

This document is about creating a new repository at [AsyncAPI Initiative GitHub organization](https://github.com/asyncapi). This guide explains what is the approval process and default repository configuration options.

This document is also helpful if you are donating a project to AsyncAPI Initiative, which involves transferring repository ownership, but still becoming its maintainer.

## Creating a repo for a new project

1. Visit [AsyncAPI Initiative Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions)
